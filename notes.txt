optional:


- Print Menu - Client has change requests to be updated 
	QUESTION: Can we make the requested changes while current dev work is still ongoing? 
	If so, when will the changes be updated? 

		- The development of the new structure will be worked on the development/staging site, so there's no problem updating the live site.

- New Product Menu Structure / Categorization - USE NEW FORMAT WHEN RE-STRUCTURING MENU
	Will the Lab Results PDFs be lost when the new products are re-imported and replace the current products in WP? 
		- Just like the old process, the lab PDF results in the sheet will be a link to the uploaded file on the site
	How are we going to import products in bulk in the new structure of the product menu/inventory?
		- We will be creating a feature for that to fit with the new menu structure (currently working)
