CSV IMPORTER

https://github.com/bahaaldine/angular-csv-import

search / filter
multiple select + bulk delete
sample csv
frontend

optional:


- Print Menu - Client has change requests to be updated 
	QUESTION: Can we make the requested changes while current dev work is still ongoing? 
	If so, when will the changes be updated? 

		- The development of the new structure will be worked on the development/staging site, so there's no problem updating the live site.

- New Product Menu Structure / Categorization - USE NEW FORMAT WHEN RE-STRUCTURING MENU
	Will the Lab Results PDFs be lost when the new products are re-imported and replace the current products in WP? 
		- Just like the old process, the lab PDF results in the sheet will be a link to the uploaded file on the site
	How are we going to import products in bulk in the new structure of the product menu/inventory?
		- We will be creating a feature for that to fit with the new menu structure (currently working)

Hi Guys,

I have finished the backend interfaces and updated the CSV import feature base on the new format. 
Here are my updates on the frontend modules(We created these modules as part of our dedicated plugin):
	Interactive Product Menu - started creating dynamic query scripts for interactive filter, All Menu page and Print Menu. Design to be followed.
	All Menu - Dependent on Interactive Product Menu
	Print Menu - Dependent on Interactive Product Menu


After finishing these items tomorrow, we will then proceed to cloning the live site and upload it to new server as "staging site" temporarily for us to test, then replace the whole menu structure with our new dedicated plugin.
